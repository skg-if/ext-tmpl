# Extended JSON-LD context

## Expected outcomes
In this extension development phase, the JSON-LD context is produced and placed as indicated in the repository structure [guidelines](../structure), in order to be served behind w3id.

For example, the current (i.e., last) version of the JSON-LD context is available at [https://w3id.org/skg-if/extension/tmpl/context/skg-if.json](https://w3id.org/skg-if/extension/tmpl/context/skg-if.json).


## Methodological considerations
This phase is manual and maps the JSON terms that will "surface" in the [extended Interoperability Framework](./extended-interoperability-framework) to the ontology [previously developed](./data-model).
