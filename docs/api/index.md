# API extensions

In this page, please document how your extension affects (if any) the optional HTTP parameters of the [API resolvers](https://skg-if.github.io/api/) described in the core specification of the SKG-IF.

Additionally, you are free to specify additional methods with customised behaviour that your extension requires to provide.
