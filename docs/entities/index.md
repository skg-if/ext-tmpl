# Extension entities

Please list here the new entities that your extension defines
For the sake of this example, we imagined to add fictional properties to [Research products]().

**Attention!** To prevent possible clashes with other extensions, each extension is assigned a unique prefix (e.g., the acronym you provided upon requesting an extension) that you need to prepend when defining new properties for core entities.
