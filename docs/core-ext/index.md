# Core extensions

Please list here the core entities that your extension affects.
For the sake of this example, we imagined to add fictional properties to [Research products](https://skg-if.github.io/interoperability-framework/docs/research-product.html).

**Attention!** To prevent possible clashes with other extensions, each extension is assigned a unique prefix (e.g., the acronym you provided upon requesting an extension) that you need to prepend when defining new properties for core entities.
