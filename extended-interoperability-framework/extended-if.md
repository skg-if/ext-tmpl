To prevent possible clashes with other extensions, each extension is assigned a unique prefix (e.g., the acronym you provided upon requesting an extension) that you need to prepend when defining new properties and relations for core entities.

## Core extensions
As an example, this template extends these core entities:
- [Research product] is extended by [Extended research product]


## Extension-specific entities
This extension introduces a [New entity].

[New entity]: {% link extension-template/extended-interoperability-framework/extension-entities/ext-new-entity.md %}
[Research product]: {% link interoperability-framework/docs/research-product.md %}
