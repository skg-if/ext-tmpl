# Extension template documentation

{: .highlight }
This page serves to kickstart the development of your extension and provide guidance in the process. Once confident with the whole process, please delete the content of this page and replace it with an introductory description of the extension, comprehending its context, scope and objectives.

{: .important }
The documentation must be written in [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org) and will be compiled automatically using [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com) against the [**Just the Docs**](https://just-the-docs.com) theme. Each time you `git push` your local commits on the remote repository, a GitHub action will wake up and take care of CD/CI. Once compiled successfully, your documentation will be deployed on GitHub Pages on the SKG-IF website, despite being initially hidden in the left-hand-side menu. Please follow the indications and the examples provided and feel free to customise it as long as it complies with the overall workflow. For debugging purposes, the execution of GitHub actions can be monitored [here](https://github.com/skg-if/skg-if.github.io/actions/workflows/pages.yml).

## Documentation checklist
In order to document the specification introduced by your extension, please use the suggested [folder structure](./structure).
In particular, the document you have to produce has to cover these fundamental aspects:
- Production of the extension [data model](/ext-tmpl/data-model/) and formal implementation in OWL;
- Production of the [SHACL](/ext-tmpl/data-model/shacl/) file;
- Production of the [JSON-LD context](/ext-tmpl/context/) for the extension;
- Description of the [extended Interoperability Framework](./extended-interoperability-framework/) (properties and relations of core and new entities);
- Provide [APIs extensions](/ext-tmpl/api/) of the core OpenAPI specs; i.e., customisations of core API resolvers (if any) and/or introduction of custom API methods (if any);
- Production of [JSON-LD examples](/ext-tmpl/examples/).
