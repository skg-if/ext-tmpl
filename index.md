# SKG-IF extension documentation

This is a documentation template created to document an SKG-IF extension.
Use this as a home page to describe the overall purpose of the extension.
Describe the context, provide contacts, and any other information you think is relevant to understand the scope of your extension and foster its uptake.

In order to document the specification introduced by your extension, please use the suggested folder structure.
In particular, the document you have to produce has to cover these fundamental aspects:
- extensions to core entities (properties and relations)
- introduction of new entities (properties and relations)
- description of the data model and formal implementation
- production of an extended JSON-LD context
- production of JSON-LD examples
- customisations of core API resolvers (if any)
- introduction of custom API methods (if any)


{: .important }
The documentation must be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) and will be compiled automatically using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) against the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com) theme. Once compiled successully it will be deployed on GitHub Pages. Please follow the indications and the examples provided and feel free to customise it as long as it complies with the overall workflow.
